What is observability? In our understanding, it is _"how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs"_. We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications. You can watch more about what we think observability is in https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/enlightning/10/[this episode of Enlightning with Jonatan Ivanov].

== How Does Micrometer Observation Work?

> The idea of its founding was that we want the users to instrument their code once using a single API and have multiple benefits out of it (e.g. metrics, tracing, logging).

This blog post details what you need to know to about that API and how you can use it to provide more insights into your application.

For any observation to happen, you need to register `ObservationHandler` objects through an `ObservationRegistry`. An `ObservationHandler` reacts only to supported implementations of an `Observation.Context` and can create, for example, timers, spans, and logs by reacting to the lifecycle events of an observation, such as:

* `start` - Observation has been started. Happens when the `Observation#start()` method gets called.
* `stop` - Observation has been stopped. Happens when the `Observation#stop()` method gets called.
* `error` - An error occurred while observing. Happens when the `Observation#error(exception)` method gets called.
* `event` - An event happened when observing. Happens when the `Observation#event(event)` method gets called.
* `scope started` - Observation opens a scope. The scope must be closed when no longer used. Handlers can create thread local variables on start that are cleared upon closing of the scope. Happens when the `Observation#openScope()` method gets called.
* `scope stopped` - Observation stops a scope. Happens when the `Observation.Scope#close()` method gets called.

Whenever any of these methods is called, an `ObservationHandler` method (such as `onStart(T extends Observation.Context ctx)`, `onStop(T extends Observation.Context ctx)`, and so on) are called. To pass state between the handler methods, you can use the `Observation.Context`.

The observation state diagram looks like this:

[source]
----
        Observation           Observation
        Context               Context
Created ----------> Started ----------> Stopped
----

The observation Scope state diagram looks like this:

[source]
----
              Observation
              Context
Scope Started ----------> Scope Closed
----

To make it possible to debug production problems, an observation needs additional metadata, such as key-value pairs (also known as tags). You can then query your metrics or distributed tracing backend by using those tags to find the required data. Tags can be of either high or low cardinality.

This is an example of the Micrometer Observation API.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../server/src/test/java/com/example/server/ObservationTests.java[tags=example]
----

IMPORTANT:  *High cardinality* means that a pair will have an unbounded number of possible values. An HTTP URL is a good
example of such a key value (for example, `/user/user1234`, `/user/user2345`, and so on). *Low cardinality* means that a key value will  have a bounded number of possible values. A *templated* HTTP URL (such as `/user/{userId}`) is a good example of such a key value.

To separate observation lifecycle operations from an observation configuration (such as names and low and high cardinality tags), you can use the `ObservationConvention` that provides an easy way of overriding the default naming conventions.

== Building Your First Observed Application

The easiest way to get started is to create a new project from https://start.spring.io.

We will build a Spring WebMvc server application and a client to call the server using RestTemplate. We start with the server side.

=== WebMvc Server Setup

Since we want to start an HTTP server, we have to pick the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.

To create observations by using the `@Observed` aspect, we need to add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop` dependency.

To add observation features to your application, choose `spring-boot-starter-actuator` (to add https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] to the classpath).

Now it is time to add observability related features!

* *Metrics*
** For Micrometer metrics with OTLP, we need to add the `io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-otlp` dependency.
* *Tracing*
** For *Tracing Context Propagation* with Micrometer Tracing, we need to pick a *tracer* bridge (*tracer* is a library that is used to handle the lifecycle of a span). We pick https://zipkin.io[Zipkin Brave] by adding the `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave`.
*** The client application that we will create for this demo will use another tracer library to show an interop between tracers.
** For *Latency Visualization*, we need to send the finished spans in some format to a server. In our case, we produce an OTLP-compliant span. To achieve that, we need to add the `io.zipkin.contrib.otel:encoder-brave` dependency.
*** To register OTLP span encoding define this bean
./src/main/java/com/example/server/com/example/server/brave/BraveOtlpConfig.java
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/java/com/example/server/brave/BraveOtlpConfig.java[tags=encoder]
----
* *Logs*
** Since we have Micrometer Tracing on the classpath, the logs are automatically correlated (that is, they contain a unique trace identifier). Now we need to ship the logs. For this demo, we ship them to https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Grafana Loki]. We can achieve that by adding the `com.github.loki4j:loki-logback-appender` dependency (check https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.loki4j/loki-logback-appender[this link] for the latest release version)

IMPORTANT: If you are new to tracing, we need to quickly define a couple of basic terms. You can wrap any operation in a `span`. It has a unique `span id` and contains timing information and some additional metadata (key-value pairs). Because you can produce child spans from spans, the whole tree of spans forms a `trace` that shares the same `trace id` (that is, a correlation identifier).

Now we need to add some configuration. We set up `actuator` and `metrics` to publish percentiles histograms. We set the sampling probability to `1.0` to send all traces to latency analysis tool. We set up the OTLP sender to point to Tempo's OTLP endpoint in HTTP Protobuf format.

./src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Since we are running the https://grafana.com/grafana/[Grafana] stack with https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] and https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/[Tempo] locally, we configure the `loki-logback-appender` to send logs to the local instance of Loki.

./src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
----

=== WebMvc Server Code

Time to write some server-side code! We want to achieve full observability of our application, including metrics, tracing, and additional logging.

To begin with, we write a controller that logs a message to the console and delegate work to a service.

.MyController.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/java/com/example/server/ServerApplication.java[tags=controller]
----

We want to have some detailed observation of the `MyUserService#userName` method. Thanks to having added AOP support, we can use the `@Observed` annotation. With Spring Boot 3.3 the aspect gets automatically registered.

.MyUserService.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/java/com/example/server/ServerApplication.java[tags=service]
----

With metrics and tracing on the classpath, having this annotation leads to the creation of a `timer`, a `long task timer`, and a `span`. The timer would be named `user.name`, the long task timer would be named `user.name.active`, and the span would be named `getting-user-name`.

What about logs? We do not want to write the logging statements manually whenever an observation takes place. What we can do is to create a dedicated handler that logs some text for each observation.

.MyHandler.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../server/src/main/java/com/example/server/ServerApplication.java[tags=handler]
----

That is it! Time for the client side.

=== RestTemplate Client Application Setup

As before, we add the `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependencies to have a web server running and Micrometer support added.

Time to add observability related features!

* *Metrics*
** For Micrometer metrics with OTLP, we need to add the `io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-otlp` dependency.
* *Tracing*
** For *Tracing Context Propagation* with Micrometer Tracing, we need to pick a *tracer* bridge (*tracer* is a library that is used to handle the lifecycle of a span). We pick https://zipkin.io[Zipkin Brave] by adding the `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave`.
*** The client application that we will create for this demo will use another tracer library to show an interop between tracers.
** For *Latency Visualization*, we need to send the finished spans in some format to a server. In our case, we produce an OTLP-compliant span. To achieve that, we need to add the `io.zipkin.contrib.otel:encoder-brave` dependency.
*** To register OTLP span encoding define this bean
./src/main/java/com/example/client/com/example/server/brave/BraveOtlpConfig.java
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../client/src/main/java/com/example/client/brave/BraveOtlpConfig.java[tags=encoder]
----
* *Logs*
** As previously, we add the `com.github.loki4j:loki-logback-appender` dependency (check https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.loki4j/loki-logback-appender[this link] for the latest release version) to ship logs to Loki.

Now we need to add some configuration. We add almost identical configuration as we did on the server side.

./src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::../../../../client/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

The Loki Appender configuration looks exactly the same.

./src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::../../../../client/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
----

=== RestTemplate Application Client Code

Now it is time to write some client-side code! We send a request with `RestTemplate` to the server side, and we want to achieve the full observability of our application, including metrics and tracing.

To begin, we need a `RestTemplate` bean that is automatically instrumented by Spring Boot. Remember to inject the `RestTemplateBuilder` and to construct a `RestTemplate` instance from the builder.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
include::../../../../client/src/main/java/com/example/client/ClientApplication.java[tags=rest-template]
}
----

Now we can write a `CommandLineRunner` bean that is wrapped by using the Observation API and that sends a request to the server side. All parts of the API are described in more detail in the following snippet.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
include::../../../../client/src/main/java/com/example/client/ClientApplication.java[tags=runner]
}
----

=== Running It All Together

We have prepared a Docker setup of the whole observability infrastructure under https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post[this link]. Follow these steps to run the infrastructure and both applications.

include::../../../../RUNNING.adoc[]

== Summary

In this blog post, we have managed to give you an introduction of the main concepts behind the Micrometer Observability API. We have also shown you how you can create observations by using the Observation API and annotations. You can also visualize the latency, see the correlated logs, and check the metrics that come from your Spring Boot applications.

You could also observe your applications by using native images with Spring Native.

== Acknowledgments

Work on the Micrometer Observability would not be possible without the extensive support of the whole Spring team, https://github.com/ttddyy/[Tadaya Tsuyukubo], https://github.com/izeye[Johnny Lim], and all the other contributors and reviewers.

== Next Steps

Based on community feedback, we will continue to improve our Observability story.
