The Spring Observability Team has been working on adding Observability support for Spring Applications for quite some time, and we are pleased to inform you that this feature will be generally available with Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3!

What is Observability? In our understanding that's _"how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs"_. We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications. You can watch more about what we think that Observability is in https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/enlightning/10/[this episode of Enlightning with Jonatan Ivanov].

The upcoming Spring Boot `3.0.0-RC1` release will contain numerous autoconfigurations for improved metrics with https://micrometer.io/docs[Micrometer] and new distributed tracing support with https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing]. The most notable changes are that it will contain inbuilt support for log correlation, https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C context propagation] will be the default propagation type, and we are adding remote baggage (key-values that would be automatically sent over the wire) support.

We have been changing the API a lot over the course of this year. The most important change is that we have introduced a new API in Micrometer: the Observation API.

> The idea of its founding was that we want the users to instrument their code once using a single API and have multiple benefits out of it (e.g. metrics, tracing, logging).

This blog post details what you need to know to about that API and how you can use it to provide more insights into your application.

= How Does Micrometer Observation Work?

On a high level, the lifecycle of an Observation looks as follows:

[source]
----
        Observation           Observation                   Observation                    Observation
        Context               Context                       Context                        Context
Created ----------> Started ----------> (Optionally) Error ----------> (Optionally) Event ----------> Stopped
                           |
                           |
                            \---------->   Scope Started   ----------> Scope Finished
                              Observation                  Observation
                              Context                      Context
----

For any Observation to happen, you need to register `ObservationHandler` objects through an `ObservationRegistry`. An `ObservationHandler` reacts only to supported implementations of an `Observation.Context` and can create timers, spans, and logs by reacting to the lifecycle events of an Observation such as

* `start` - Observation has been started. Happens when the `Observation#start()` method gets called.
* `stop` - Observation has been stopped. Happens when the `Observation#stop()` method gets called.
* `error` - An error occurred while observing. Happens when the `Observation#error(exception)` method gets called.
* `event` - An event happened when observing. Happens when the `Observation#event(event)` method gets called.
* `scope started` - Observation opens a Scope. The Scope must be closed when no longer used. Handlers can create thread local variables on start that are cleared upon closing of the scope. Happens when the `Observation#openScope()` method gets called.
* `scope stopped` - Observation stops a Scope. Happens when the `Observation.Scope#close()` method gets called.

Whenever a state transition happens, an `ObservationHandler` method (such as `onStart(T extends Observation.Context ctx)`, `onStop(T extends Observation.Context ctx)`, and so on) are called. To pass state between the handler methods, you can use the `Observation.Context`.

To separate Observation lifecycle operations from an Observation configuration (such as names and low and high cardinality tags), you can use the `ObservationConvention` that provides an easy way of overriding the default naming conventions.

IMPORTANT:  *High cardinality* means that a key value will have an unbounded number of possible values. An HTTP URL is a good
example of such a key value (e.g. `/foo/bar`, `/foo/baz` etc.). *Low cardinality* means that a key value will  have a bounded number of possible values. A templated HTTP URL is a good example of such a key value (e.g. `/foo/{userId}`).

The main idea behind the `Observations` and the `ObservationHandlers` is that -- something is missing here.

= Building Your First Observed Application

The easiest way to get started is to create a new project from https://start.spring.io. Make sure to select Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 and your favorite build tool.

We will build a Spring WebMvc server application and a client that will call the server using RestTemplate. We start with the server side.

== WebMvc Server Setup

Since we want to start an HTTP server, we have to pick the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.

To add aspect support, we need to add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop` dependency.

You need to chose `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to add observation features to your application (to add https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] to the classpath).

Now it's time to add observability related features!

* *Metrics*
** For Micrometer metrics with Prometheus, we need to add the `io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus` dependency.
* *Tracing*
** For *Tracing Context Propagation*, with Micrometer Tracing, we need to pick a *tracer* bridge (*tracer* is a library that is used to handle the lifecycle of a span). We will pick https://zipkin.io[Zipkin Brave] by adding the `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave`.
** For *Latency Visualization*, we need to send the finished spans in some format to a server. In our case we will produce an Zipkin-compliant span. To achieve that, we need to add a `io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave` dependency.
* *Logs*
** Since we have tracing-related metrics on the classpath, the logs will be automatically correlated (they will contain a unique trace identifier). Now we need to ship the logs. For this demo, we will ship them to https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Grafana Loki]. We can achieve that by adding the `com.github.loki4j:loki-logback-appender:latest.release` dependency.

IMPORTANT: If you are new to tracing, we need to quickly define a couple of basic terms. You can wrap any operation in a `span`. It has a unique `span id`, contains timing information and some additional metadata (key-value pairs). Because you can produce child spans from spans, the whole tree of spans forms a `trace` that shares the same `trace id` (that is a correlation identifier).

Now we need to add some configuration. We will set up `actuator` and `metrics` to publish percentiles histograms, and we will redefine the logging pattern to include the trace and span identifiers.

./src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
server.port=7654
spring.application.name=server

# For demo purposes we expose all actuator endpoints (especially the prometheus one)
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=true
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# For exemplars support
management.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.http.server.requests=true

# traceID and spanId are predefined MDC keys
logging.pattern.level=%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}]
----

Since we will be running the https://grafana.com/grafana/[Grafana] stack with https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] and https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/[Tempo] locally, we will configure the `loki-logback-appender` to send logs to the local instance of loki.

./src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml" />
    <springProperty scope="context" name="appName" source="spring.application.name"/>

    <appender name="LOKI" class="com.github.loki4j.logback.Loki4jAppender">

        <appender-ref ref="LOKI"/>
    </root>
</configuration>

== WebMvc Server Code

Time to write some server-side code! We would like to achieve full observability of our application, including metrics, tracing, and additional logging.

To begin with, we write a controller that will log a message to the console and delegate work to a service.

.MyController.java
[source,java]
----
@RestController
class MyController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyController.class);
    private final MyService myService;

    MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/foo")
    String myMapping() {
        log.info("Got a request");
        return myService.foo();
    }
}
----

We would like to have some detailed observation of the `MyService#foo` method. Thanks to having added AOP support, we can use the `@Observed` annotation -- we can just register a `ObservedAspect` bean.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
    // To have the @Observed support we need to register this aspect
    @Bean
    ObservedAspect observedAspect(ObservationRegistry observationRegistry) {
        return new ObservedAspect(observationRegistry);
    }
}
----

.MyService.java
[source,java]
----
@Service
class MyService {

    private final Random random = new Random();

    // Example of using an annotation to observe methods
    @Observed(name = "foo.metric",
            contextualName = "my-contextual-name",
            lowCardinalityKeyValues = {"low.cardinality.key", "low cardinality value"})
    String foo() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(random.nextLong(200L)); // simulates latency
        }
        catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return "foo";
    }
}
----

With metrics and tracing on the classpath, having this annotation will lead to creation of a `timer`, a `long task timer`, and a `span`. The timer would be named `foo.metric`, the long task timer would be named `foo.metric.active`, and a span would be named `my-contextual-name`.

What about logs? We do not want to write the logging statements manually whenever an observation takes place. What we can do is to create a dedicated handler that will log some text for each observation.

.MyHandler.java
[source,java]
----
// Example of plugging in a custom handler that in this case will print a statement before and after all observations take place
@Component
class MyHandler implements ObservationHandler<Observation.Context> {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyHandler.class);

    @Override
    public void onStart(Observation.Context context) {
        log.info("Before running the observation for context [{}]", context.getName());
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop(Observation.Context context) {
        log.info("After running the observation for context [{}]", context.getName());
    }

    @Override
    public boolean supportsContext(Observation.Context context) {
        return true;
    }
}
----

You might wonder what you should do to have the observability turned on for the controllers? You can register one bean and be ready to go. In the future we, will provide a more automated solution.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
    // You must set this manually until this is registered in Boot
    @Bean
    FilterRegistrationBean observationWebFilter(ObservationRegistry observationRegistry) {
        FilterRegistrationBean filterRegistrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean(new HttpRequestsObservationFilter(observationRegistry));
        filterRegistrationBean.setDispatcherTypes(DispatcherType.ASYNC, DispatcherType.ERROR, DispatcherType.FORWARD,
                DispatcherType.INCLUDE, DispatcherType.REQUEST);
        filterRegistrationBean.setOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE);
        // We provide a list of URLs that we want to create observations for
        filterRegistrationBean.setUrlPatterns(Collections.singletonList("/foo"));
        return filterRegistrationBean;
    }
}
----

That is it! Time for the client side.

== RestTemplate Client Application Setup

As before, we will add the `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependencies to have a web server running and Micrometer support added.

Time to add observability related features!

* *Metrics*
** For Micrometer metrics with Prometheus, we need to add the `io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus` dependency.
* *Tracing*
** For *Tracing Context Propagation*, with Micrometer Tracing, we need to pick a *tracer* bridge. We will pick https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry] by adding the `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel`.
** For *Latency Visualization*, we need to send the finished spans in some format to a server. In our case, we will produce an OpenZipkin compliant span. To achieve that, we need to add a `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin` dependency
* *Logs*
** As previously, we will add the `com.github.loki4j:loki-logback-appender:latest.release` dependency to ship logs to Loki.

Now we need to add some configuration. We will have almost identical configuration as on the server side. However, we will also add `management.tracing.sampling.probability=1.0` to ensure that all spans are always sent to the latency analysis server.

./src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
server.port=6543
spring.application.name=client

# All traces should be sent to latency analysis tool
management.tracing.sampling.probability=1.0
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=true
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# To get exemplars
management.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.http.server.requests=true

# traceID and spanId are predefined MDC keys
logging.pattern.level=%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}]
----

The Loki Appender configuration looks exactly the same.

./src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml" />
    <springProperty scope="context" name="appName" source="spring.application.name"/>

    <appender name="LOKI" class="com.github.loki4j.logback.Loki4jAppender">
        <http>
            <url>http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push</url>
        </http>
        <format>
            <label>
                <pattern>app=${appName},host=${HOSTNAME},traceID=%X{traceId:-NONE},level=%level</pattern>
            </label>
            <message>
                <pattern>${FILE_LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
            </message>
            <sortByTime>true</sortByTime>
        </format>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="LOKI"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
----

== RestTemplate Application Client Code

Now it is time to write some client-side code! We will send a request with `RestTemplate` to the server side, and we would like to achieve the full observability of our application, including metrics and tracing.

To begin, we need a `RestTemplate` bean that will be automatically instrumented by Spring Boot. Remember to inject the `RestTemplateBuilder` and construct a `RestTemplate` instance from the builder.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
    // IMPORTANT! To instrument RestTemplate you must inject the RestTemplateBuilder
    @Bean
    RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
        return builder.build();
    }
}
----

Now we can write a `CommandLineRunner` bean that will be wrapped by using the Observation API and that will send a request to the server side. All parts of the API are described in more detail in the following snippet.

.MyConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    CommandLineRunner myCommandLineRunner(ObservationRegistry registry, RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        return args -> {
            // Example of using the Observability API manually
            // <my.observation> is a "technical" name that does not depend on the context. It will be used to name e.g. Metrics
             Observation.createNotStarted("my.observation", registry)
                     // Low cardinality means that the number of potential values won't be big. Low cardinality entries will end up in e.g. Metrics
                    .lowCardinalityKeyValue("low.cardinality.key", "low cardinality value")
                     // High cardinality means that the number of potential values can be large. High cardinality entries will end up in e.g. Spans
                    .highCardinalityKeyValue("high.cardinality.key", "high cardinality value")
                     // <command-line-runner> is a "contextual" name that gives more details within the provided context. It will be used to name e.g. Spans
                    .contextualName("command-line-runner")
                     // The following lambda will be executed with an observation scope (e.g. all the MDC entries will be populated with tracing information). Also the observation will be started, stopped and if an error occurred it will be recorded on the observation
                    .observe(() -> {
                        log.info("Will send a request to the server"); // Since we're in an observation scope - this log line will contain tracing MDC entries ...
                        String response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://localhost:7654/foo", String.class); // Boot's RestTemplate instrumentation creates a child span here
                        log.info("Got response [{}]", response); // ... so will this line
                    });

        };
    }
}
----

== Running It All Together

We have prepared a Docker setup of the whole Observability infrastructure under https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post[this link]. Follow these steps to run the infrastructure and both applications:

=== Running the samples

To run the samples:

. Start up the observability stack (for demonstration purposes, you can use the provided Grafana, Tempo, and Loki stack) and wait for it to start.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----
+
* To access Prometheus go to http://localhost:9090/
* To access Grafana go to http://localhost:3000/ (Grafana credentials: admin:admin)

. Run the server side application (this will block your current terminal window).
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :server
----

. Run the client side application (this will block your current terminal window)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :client
----
+
You should see log statements similar to these:
+
[source]
----
2022-10-04T15:04:55.345+02:00  INFO [client,bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Will send a request to the server
2022-10-04T15:04:55.385+02:00  INFO [client,bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Got response [foo]
----

. Go to http://localhost:3000/[Grafana], go to dashboards, and click on the `Logs, Traces, Metrics` dashboard. There you can pick a trace ID value (for example, `bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9`) to find all logs and traces from both applications that correspond to that trace ID. You should see a following correlated view of logs and traces related to the same trace identifier, and you will see metrics taking place at the same time range. The metrics are related to HTTP request processing latency. These come from the automated Spring Boot WebMvc instrumentation that uses the Micrometer API.
+
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/logs_metrics_traces.jpeg[]
+
Notice a diamond shape in the metrics. These are https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/basics/exemplars/[`Exemplars`]. Those are "`specific trace representative of measurement taken in a given time interval`". If you click on the shape, you can jump to the trace ID view to see the corresponding trace.
+
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/exemplar.png[]

. Either click on the trace ID to `Query it with Tempo` or go to Tempo and pick the trace identifier yourself. You will see the following screen.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/trace-view.png[]

Each bar represents a `span`. You can see how much time it took for each operation to complete. If you click on a given span, you can see tags (key-value metadata) and timing information related to that particular operation.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/span-tags.png[]

This is how the correlated logs view would look in Loki.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/correlated-logs.png[]

If you want to see the `@Observed` annotated method metrics, you can go to the `Prometheus` view and find the `foo_metric` Timer.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/foo-metric.png[]

If you want to see the metrics from your Observation that you have manually created, go to the `Prometheus` view and find the `my_observation` Timer.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcingrzejszczak/observability-boot-blog-post/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/img/my-observation.png[]

= Summary

In this blog post, we have managed to give you an introduction of the main concepts behind the Micrometer Observability API. We have also shown you how you can create observations by using the Observation API and annotations. You were also able to visualize the latency, see the correlated logs, and check the metrics that come from you Spring Boot applications.

= Next Steps

Based on community feedback, we will continue to improve our Observability story. We intend to go GA in November this year.

This is an exciting time for us. We would again like to thank everyone who has already contributed and reported feedback, and we look forward to further feedback!
